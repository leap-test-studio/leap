## What is Test Automation?

The term **automation** refers to the automatic handling of various industrial processes. Test automation is the practice of automatically reviewing and validating a software product, such as a web application, to make sure it meets predefined quality standards for code style, functionality (business logic), and user experience.

Testing practices typically involve the following stages:

- **Unit testing:** validates individual units of code, such as a function, so it works as expected
- **Integration testing:** ensures several pieces of code can work together without unintended consequences
- **End-to-end testing:** validates that the application meets the user’s expectations
- **Exploratory testing:** takes an unstructured approach to reviewing numerous areas of an application from the user perspective, to uncover
  functional or visual issues

## What is a Test Framework?

**Testing frameworks** are an essential part of any successful automated testing process. They can reduce maintenance costs and testing efforts
and will provide a higher return on investment (ROI) for QA teams looking to optimize their agile processes.

A testing framework is a set of guidelines or rules used for creating and designing test cases. A framework is comprised
of a combination of practices and tools that are designed to help QA professionals test more efficiently. These guidelines could include coding standards,
test-data handling methods, object repositories, processes for storing test results, or information on how to access external resources. While these are
not mandatory rules and testers can still script or record tests without following them, using an organized framework typically provides additional benefits
that would otherwise be missed out on.

## Benefits of a Test Automation Framework

Utilizing a framework for automated testing will increase a team’s test speed and efficiency, improve
test accuracy, and will reduce test maintenance costs as well as lower risks. They are essential to an efficient automated testing process for a few key
reasons:

- No/low Code
- Improved test efficiency
- Lower maintenance costs
- Minimal manual intervention
- Maximum test coverage
- Reusability

## Types of Automated Testing Frameworks

There are seven common types of test automation frameworks, each with their own architecture and differing
benefits and disadvantages. When building out a test plan, it’s important to choose the framework that is right for you.

- Linear Automation Framework: record-and-playback
- Modular Based Testing Framework: isolation
- Library Architecture Testing Framework: scripts
- Data-Driven Framework: External data
- Keyword-Driven Framework
- Hybrid Testing Framework
- Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Framework
